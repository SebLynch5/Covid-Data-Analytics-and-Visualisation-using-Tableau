# COVID-19 Data Analytics & Visualisation (Tableau)

This project involves exploring and visualising global COVID-19 data using Tableau. It focuses on creating interactive dashboards to uncover patterns, compare countries, and track the progression of the pandemic over time.

## Overview

Using publicly available COVID-19 data, I created a series of visualisations in Tableau to answer key analytical questions related to the spread and severity. These visual insights were then analysed and presented in a structured format.

## Files Included

- `Covid_Dashboard.twb` – Tableau Workbook containing all interactive dashboards and visualisations.
- `Covid_Presentation.pptx` – A PowerPoint presentation providing analysis and commentary on the visualisations.
